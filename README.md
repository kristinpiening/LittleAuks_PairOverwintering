# LittleAuks_PairOverwintering

This repository is associated with the manuscript titled: "Together yet apart: subtle sex differences and pair cohesion in migrating and wintering strategies of a monomorphic seabird, the little auk (Alle alle)"

This repository is intended for the project on Little Auk pair overwintering. Firstly, we assessed sex differences in the little auks overwintering behaviour. Then, we planned to find out whether or not the pair stays together / meets along the way and how this may influence or is influenced by past and future breeding outcomes of the pair.
